  	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
  		<p>Artemis  is a humanitarian effort dedicated towards enhancing the human race in  preparation for our exploration of the cosmos. We were founded in 2164 after  the population expedition of Mars by Pilot Alessia  Adrian of the original  Artemis space expedition to Jupiter in 2078. While we are partnered with  various governments across the globe, our main headquarters is in 3735 Farmhouse  Rd, Houston, TX. If you have questions please call <em>987-476-2689</em> or email <a href="mailto:Artemis_home@gmail.com">Artemis_home@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  	<h2>What do we sell?</h2>
  		<p> All products sold by Artemis are organic products found on  the moon itself. Currently, we only offer our signature  Moonstones&#8482; -genetically enhancing gemstones that we mine on our base  on the moon- but Artemis is proud to announce that in the next few years,  additional commodities like Moon Dust&#8482; and Moonlight&#8482; will be available to  consumers as well. (For more information on Moonstones&#8482;, please go to our products page.)</p>

  		<p>Moon Dust&#8482; are unique types of powders found on the moon that  can be incorporated into medicines, foods, etc. and consumed to receive certain  enhancements. They will be offered in Black Dust&#8482; (which enhances stealth), Grey  Dust&#8482; (which decreases gravities effect on the human body), and White Dust&#8482;  (which enhances human healing and is to be incorporated solely with medicines).  </p>
  		<center><p><img src="moon_dust.jpg" alt="grey and white dust" width="160" height="160"></p></center>
  		<p>Moonlight&#8482; will be sold within the next decade. It is lunar-radiation that our  scientists are currently engineering to be safer for human application. Unlike  Moon Dust&#8482; or even Moonstones&#8482;, the effects of Moonlight&#8482; will be permanent and  its final stage of development will be our last product. There will be two  types (enhancement explanations to be added in 2 years); which are  Sun-reflected Moonlight&#8482; and Moon-made Moonlight&#8482;.</p>
