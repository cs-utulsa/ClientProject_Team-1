  <h3>Moonstones&#8482;</h3>
  <p>Our signature  Moonstones&#8482; are genetically enhancing gemstones that are mined on our base  on the moon. Moonstones&#8482; come in a variety of jewels and since we are a globally sponsored company, we can only offer certain gemstones to the public for their own saftey.* In addition, you must be of 18 years or older to place an order.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Diamonds enhance physical 
      <label>strength</label>
    and general reflexes</li>
    <li>Pearls enhance 
      <label>telekinesis </label>
    as well as basic intelligence</li>
    <li>Rubies enhance empathy and the human ability to withstand extremely warm temperatures (recommended for desert travel)</li>
    <li>Sapphires enhance swimming skills, agility, and the human ability to withstand extremely cold climates (recommended for artic travel)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prices are based on the purity of the gem, the lower the purity the less of an enhancement but at a cheaper price.  </p>
<ul>
    <li> 10% - $299 </li>
    <li>25% - $399 </li>
    <li>50% - $859 </li>
    <li>100% - $1998</li>
  </ul>
<p>There are different sizes of Moonstones&#8482; as well (small, medium and large) which do not affect the price or purity in anyway. For example; a large diamond will <b>not</b> create a stronger enhancement than a small diamond. However Moonstones&#8482; sizes in large and medium are rarer than small sizes, so please keep in mind that the shipping time will increase by <b>at least</b> 3 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, in order for the Moonstones&#8482; to be worn, the  consumer must pick out the material for the band or bracelet. There is no  additional cost since the material chosen doesn't affect the enhancements of  the stones.Â  However, gold and silver  bands/bracelets take an <strong>additional</strong> 3 weeks of shipping.</p>
